# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Start Next.js dev server
npm run build            # Production build
npm run lint             # ESLint
npm run test             # Vitest (run once)
npm run test:watch       # Vitest (watch mode)
npm run db:push          # Push Drizzle schema to Neon Postgres (no migration files)
npm run db:generate      # Generate Drizzle migration files
npm run db:migrate       # Apply migrations
npm run db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio for DB inspection
npm run collect:github   # Fetch GitHub stars/forks for all tools, compute momentum scores
npm run collect:hn       # Fetch HN mentions (7d), update momentum scores with HN boost
npm run collect:all      # Run both collectors sequentially
```

Collection scripts also seed the `tools` table from `src/data/tools.json` on first run.

## Architecture

**Two-feature product:** a momentum leaderboard (daily-updated tool rankings) and an architecture generator (Claude-powered stack recommendations using live leaderboard data as context).

### Data Flow

1. **tools.json** → master list of ~60 AI tools with GitHub repos, categories, HN search terms
2. **collect-github.ts** → GitHub API → `github_snapshots` table → computes `star_velocity` → writes `momentum_scores`
3. **collect-hn.ts** → HN Algolia API → `hn_snapshots` table → adds HN boost to `momentum_scores`
4. **Leaderboard page** → SSR queries latest `momentum_scores` + `github_snapshots` per tool
5. **Architecture generator** → fetches all tools with scores as context → sends to Claude with tool_use for structured output → renders Mermaid diagram client-side

### Scoring Algorithm

```
star_velocity = (stars_new - stars_old) / days_between_snapshots
hn_boost = (hn_points_7d × 0.1) + (hn_mentions_7d × 2)
overall_score = star_velocity + hn_boost
```

### Key Patterns

- **Database:** Drizzle ORM with `postgres` driver connecting to Neon Postgres. Schema in `src/lib/schema.ts`. All snapshot tables use unique `(toolId, collectedAt)` indices for time-series data. Latest values are queried via `orderBy(desc(collectedAt)).limit(1)`.
- **Anthropic API:** The generate endpoint uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 selects tools + describes architecture via `tool_use`, Stage 2 generates focused Mermaid code. Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`.
- **Mermaid diagrams:** Rendered client-side via dynamic import with svg-pan-zoom for interactivity. Server-side validation via `mermaid.parse()` with auto-repair loop (up to 3 attempts). Falls back to raw `<pre>` on render failure.
- **SSE streaming:** The generate endpoint streams progress via Server-Sent Events. Client uses `useGenerateStream` hook with `parseSSEBuffer` for progressive UI updates.
- **Shared stacks:** Stored with nanoid(10) IDs in `shared_stacks` table. Shareable at `/stack/[id]`.
- **Stack health analysis:** `/analyze` page fetches repo dependency files via GitHub API, cross-references against momentum leaderboard, generates health report with Claude.
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/collect-data.yml` runs both collectors daily at 6am UTC. Requires `DATABASE_URL` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` secrets.

### Environment Variables

All required in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`):

- `DATABASE_URL` — Neon Postgres connection string
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — GitHub fine-grained PAT (no special permissions, just for rate limits)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — for architecture generator

## CLI Tools

### Neon CLI (`neonctl`)

Use for database branching — create isolated database copies for safe schema changes and testing.

```bash
neonctl branches list                              # List all database branches
neonctl branches create --name dev-feature-x       # Create a branch (instant copy-on-write)
neonctl connection-string dev-feature-x            # Get connection string for a branch
neonctl branches delete dev-feature-x              # Clean up when done
```

**Before any schema change:**
1. `neonctl branches create --name schema-test`
2. Use the branch connection string: `DATABASE_URL=$(neonctl connection-string schema-test)`
3. Run `npm run db:push` against the branch
4. Verify with `npm run collect:github`
5. If good, apply to main. If bad, `neonctl branches delete schema-test`

### Vercel CLI (`vercel`)

Use for deployment management, environment variables, and production logs.

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local           # Sync env vars from Vercel to local
vercel                               # Deploy preview (no --prod = preview)
vercel --prod                        # Deploy to production
vercel logs <deployment-url>         # View runtime/function logs
vercel rollback                      # Roll back production to previous deployment
vercel inspect <url>                 # Get deployment details (build time, regions)
```

### Graphite CLI (`gt`)

Use for stacked PRs — when a feature spans multiple logical changes that should be reviewed independently.

```bash
gt create -m "add schema migration"  # Create a new stacked branch + commit
gt create -m "add API route"         # Stack another change on top
gt create -m "add UI component"      # Stack another
gt submit --stack                    # Push all branches + create/update linked PRs
gt sync                              # Pull trunk, delete merged branches, restack
gt log                               # Visualize the stack as a tree
gt up / gt down                      # Navigate between stacked branches
gt restack                           # Rebase all upstack branches after a change
```

Use `gt` instead of `git` for branch operations when building stacked PRs. Fall back to `git` + `gh` for simple single-branch work.

### GitHub CLI (`gh`) — Advanced Commands

Beyond basic PR operations, use these for debugging and automation:

```bash
gh run list                          # List recent GitHub Actions runs
gh run view <run-id> --log           # View full logs (debug collect-data.yml failures)
gh run watch <run-id>                # Watch a running workflow
gh pr checks <pr-number>            # Show CI check status for a PR
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments  # Read PR review comments
gh secret set SECRET_NAME            # Set/rotate a repository secret
```

### Drizzle Kit — Hidden Features

Already installed. These commands are useful beyond the standard `push`/`generate`/`migrate`:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit introspect           # Reverse-engineer live DB into schema file (detect drift)
npx drizzle-kit check                # Validate migration consistency across branches
```

### Quick npx Patterns

No install required — useful for occasional tasks:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit                     # Fast type-check without full build
npx depcheck                         # Find unused dependencies
npx npm-check-updates -u             # Update all deps to latest versions
```

## Development Workflow

### Planning First

- **Use plan mode for anything non-trivial.** Before writing code, explore the relevant files, understand what exists, and present an approach. "Non-trivial" = touches more than 2-3 files, adds a new feature, changes data flow, or has multiple valid approaches.
- **Ask clarifying questions** rather than assuming intent. A wrong assumption wastes more time than a quick question.
- **Identify what changes and what doesn't.** Most tasks only need to touch a small surface area — find it before writing anything.

### Incremental Changes

- **One logical change at a time.** Don't combine a refactor with a feature addition. Don't fix a bug while adding something new. Each change should be independently understandable.
- **Build → verify → commit → next thing.** After every meaningful change: run `npm run build` to catch type errors, visually verify in the browser if it's a UI change, then commit. Don't stack up multiple uncommitted changes.
- **Commit messages should say why, not what.** The diff shows what changed. The message explains the intent.

### Avoiding AI Slop

- **Read before writing.** Always read the files being modified first. Match the existing patterns, naming conventions, and style — don't introduce new abstractions or utilities that duplicate what's already there.
- **Don't over-abstract.** If something is used once, it doesn't need its own file, utility function, or abstraction layer. Inline it. Extract only when there's actual duplication.
- **No placeholder or demo code.** Every line should be functional. Don't add TODO comments for things that should just be built now, and don't leave stub implementations.
- **Minimal dependencies.** Before adding an npm package, check if the functionality can be achieved in <20 lines of code. Fewer dependencies = less maintenance.
- **Delete code that isn't needed.** Unused imports, commented-out blocks, dead functions — remove them. The git history preserves everything.

### Verification

- **`npm run build` is the primary check.** TypeScript compilation catches most issues. Run it after every change.
- **`npm run lint` for style issues.** Run before committing.
- **Test data pipeline changes** with `npm run collect:github` (or `collect:hn`) against the real DB. The scripts are idempotent — safe to re-run.
- **Browser-check UI changes.** Screenshots and snapshots catch layout issues that types can't.
